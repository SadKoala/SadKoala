- 👋 Hi, I’m @SadKoala
- 👀 I’m interested in 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to use RStudio to process multispectral data collected via UAV
- 💞️ I’m looking for help with R scripts that delineate tree crowns and generating reflectance values based on where the treetops are (LiDAR and multispectral images cover the same area so the shp files from the treetops ca be overlaid on the multispectral layers)
- 📫 How to reach me: I think you can just reach me on here?
- 😄 Pronouns: She/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm not actually a sad koala
